Modify software information after packaging with [pkg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg)

# how to use

1. Introduce pkg-edit in the current project: `npm i -D pkg-edit`
2. Initialize configuration information (only needs to be executed once): `npx pkg-edit init`, It will generate a pkg.config.js in your project

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     // You need to pay attention to this, this is the exe file generated by pkg
     file: "./release/build.exe",
     // ...
   };
   ```

3. You can edit your `package.json` like this:
   ```jsonc
   {
     // ...
     "scripts": {
       "build:win": "pkg -t win -o release/build.exe src/index.js && pkg-edit build"
       // pkg saves the exe file to release/build.exe, pkg-edit will read and modify it according to the configuration
     }
     // ...
   }
   ```

## can also be used like this

1. Execute `npx pkg-edit` init in the project directory
2. You can view `pkg.config.js` and modify some predefined configurations. **You must specify the `file` field to point to the exe packaged by `pkg`**
3. Execute `npx pkg-edit build`, it will generate a new exe file according to the content of `pkg.config.js`
